<h3>League Format</h3>

<ul>
  <li>8 teams, 1 division</li>
  <li>Top 4 teams qualify for playoffs; tie-breaker is total points scored</li>
  <li>Playoffs weeks 13-16, 2 weeks per playoff matchup</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rosters</h3>

<ul>
  <li>1x QB</li>
  <li>2x RB</li>
  <li>3x WR</li>
  <li>1x TE</li>
  <li>2x RB/WR/TE flex</li>
  <li>11x Bench</li>
  <li>1x IR</li>
</ul>

<p>Only players listed as out (O) or injured reserve (IR) can be moved to the IR roster spot. Once a player has returned from being out or injured reserve they must be moved out of the IR roster spot before any other players can be added to to the roster, either by trade, waivers or the draft.</p>

<h3>Contracts</h3>

<p>All rostered players must be under contract. Contracts are offered on a yearly basis, with all contracts terminating shortly before the free-agent draft of the appropriate season. Contracts can run from a minimum of 1 year to a maximum of 5 years, with a maximum number of contracted years per team of 50.</p>

<p>Players are contracted at a fixed salary, which must be paid each year. Each team has a cap of $200 for player salaries. If a contract is terminated early (i.e. the player is dropped from their team) they are guaranteed 50% of the value of their contract for any remaining years including the current year. Players must still be paid this guaranteed salary even in the case of injury or retirement.</p>

<p>Once a player reaches the end of their contract they are immediately released as free-agents.</p>

<h3>The Draft</h3>

<p>Each year there will be a free-agent auction draft, where each team is free to sign any free-agents to new contracts. The draft takes the form of an auction; the teams take turns to nominate a player for auction, all teams are then free to bid, with the player going to the highest bidder. If a player is won at auction, they must be offered a contract equal in value to the winning bid. The length of the contract is not determined during the auction. After the draft is finished, all teams have 1 week to decide the length of the contracts offered to any drafted players. All teams are required to offer a contract of at least 1 year to all players that they have placed a winning bid for, however if a player is nominated for $1 and no other team bids, this player can be dropped at no cost during this 1 week period.</p>

<h3>Waivers</h3>

<p>Waivers are run through a Free Agent Auction Budget system. This is a "blind-bid" auction system whereby each team places a secret bid for any player they would like to acquire. The highest bid received at the time waivers process wins the player on a 1 year contract at the value of the winning bid. This contract can be extended by up to 2 years (for a total of 3 years) at a cost of $6 per year. If the option to extend the contract is used, the new contract length must be communicated to the league within a week of the waiver pickup processing.</p>

<p>Waivers will process at 6pm GMT/BST on Wednesdays and Saturdays (N.B. ESPN uses american time, and daylight savings is 1 week out of sync between UK and US, so waivers may process at 5pm on the week american daylight savings time finishes).</p>

<p>If a player has been dropped by a team, that team is ineligible to bid for them during the same waiver period that they were dropped.</p>

<h3>Trades</h3>

<p>Players can be traded at any time, however there will be a 48 hour review period during which either of the teams involved may cancel the trade. Other teams are encouraged to offer alternative trade proposals during this period.</p>

<p>The value of a player's contract cannot be altered during a trade, however the length of the contract can be extended for 1 year at the cost of $6. If a team wishes to extend a contract in this manner it must be communicated to the league within 1 week of the trade processing. A player's contract can only be extended in this way once, and the player cannot be traded directly back to their original team without being rostered by a third team.</p>

<p>Trades can also include the trading of salary cap. Any amount of salary cap can be traded for up to 5 years (including the year in which the trade is made). Trades involving salary cap do not need to include players.</p>

<p>There are no trade vetoes. The league reserves the right to cancel trades involving obvious collusion, however it is each owner's responsibility to make sure their trades are fair.</p>

<h3>Sanctions</h3>

<p>If any of the above rules are broken, a salary cap fine of $10 can be implemented. These fines last for 1 year from the date of the infraction. It is possible to incur multiple concurrent fines.</p>

<h3>Rule Alterations</h3>

<p>All members are free to propose rule changes, and any rule changes will be voted on by the league. A rule change requires a majority vote in order to be implemented at the start of the next season, or a unanimous vote in order to be implemented immediately.</p>
